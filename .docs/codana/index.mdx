Code intelligence for AI assistants. Codanna indexes your codebase, understands relationships between symbols, and answers questions about your code through natural language.

## Built for Rapid Exploration

Codanna came from our need for rapid research and exploration with proper context. During R&D, quick POCs, and pair-programming sessions, we needed instant answers about our codebase. LSP servers were too slow for that rapid-fire questioning.

**Speed for iterative exploration:** When you're in research mode or building a POC, you ask dozens of questions rapidly. Codanna's &lt;10ms lookups keep up with your thought process.

**Human+LLM pair programming:** The human stays in control. You can run the same queries the AI runs, pipe results through Unix tools, verify context before the AI acts. The `--watch` flag means the index updates as you code.

**Semantic understanding:** Find code by concept - "where's the retry logic?" - without knowing exact names. Embedding-based search understands what code does from its documentation.
